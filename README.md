This program takes works on using functions levergaging classes to create instances of a savings account and cd account.

To begin the user is prompted to enter the beginning savings balance, interest rate, and number of months.  The program then calls the create_savings_account function to pass the variables from the user.  Within the create_savings_account function an instance of the 'Account' class is created to help set the interest rate and balance of the account.  The balance is set and updated with the calculated interest earned on the account.  The new balance and interest earned on the savings account is then displayed to the user. 

This process is repeated for a cd account, leveraging the create_cd_account function and as well as the 'Account' class. The balance is set and updated with the calculated interest earned.  The new balance and interest earned on the cd are presented to the user.
